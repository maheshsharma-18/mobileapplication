# my_counter_app

A new Flutter project.

## Preview in GitHub Codespaces (recommended)

Codespaces typically can't run an Android emulator UI, so the easiest preview is Flutter Web via `web-server` and port forwarding.

From the repo root:

1. Install dependencies:
	- `cd /workspaces/mobileapplication/my_counter_app`
	- `../flutter/bin/flutter pub get`

2. Start the web server (binds to all interfaces for port forwarding):
	- `../flutter/bin/flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname 0.0.0.0 --web-port 8080`

3. In Codespaces, open the forwarded port `8080` (Ports tab -> Open in Browser).
